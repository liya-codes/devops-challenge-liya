first of all i had to make sure i have all the Prerequisites
i created a fresh new docker hub and github accounts

after that i forked the github repo that was given and i started thinking about how im gonna create this whole thing?
also i signed up to travis ci and read a bit of their documentation.
also as i was reading the whole assigment ihad a f like  my problem was how am i gonna push 
some links - for me:

https://app.travis-ci.com/account/repositories
https://github.com/liya-codes/devops-challenge-liya


my first thought was to start with a simple router that conntects to the database
what i read: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_dynamodb_code_examples.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/programming-with-python.html


for first local run i installed venv and ran it locally - had a problem :
".\.venv\Scripts\activate : File C:\projects\liya\devops-challenge-liya\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled 
on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ .\.venv\Scripts\activate
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess"

fixed it by using the command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser


after going into the venv i downloaded all the packages that are in my requirements. and i ran my basic fastapi
that connects to the database and reads all the tables

downloading packages:
python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt --no-cache

starting fastapi:

 uvicorn app.app:app --reload


after that i added some env vars and i tried to connet to the db, created .env file and create a config.py file that will load those env vars
after i connected to the database i tried getting the item from the needed table

how to connet: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48645867/how-to-establish-a-connection-to-dynamodb-using-python-using-boto3


how to read an item:
https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/client/get_item.html

error: 
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the GetItem operation: The provided key element does not match the schema


after reading the problem i realise it can only mean 3 things:
There is a sort key in addition to the partition key - I assumed its not the case since there is no mention to it in the assignment.
There is no row with code_name = thedoctor. 
There is no row named code_name.


because it was late at night i decided to continue other things so i created my Dockerfile

since i have been stucked on this problem for a few hours i decided to ask eliran and he explained to me that the row is in camelcase and it finally worked!!

after elirans help i finished the get secret router and it worked

after that i started working on travis ci - its my first time working with travis so i started by reading thier documentation
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorials/tutorial-python/

i tried running a basic ci and it didnt work - the problem is that the name of the file was .travis.yaml and not .travis.yml
okay i paid for travis bc it didnt work without but now it works

started by writing all the stages and what i need which is : build test and deploy
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/

first i started with the build stage - did it many times was not a problem

now i got into the tests stage - 
decided to use a linter like flake8 and pytest to test the application

i also decided to put to seperate the linting and unit testing so i put lint before i build my image

after i finished those 2 stages i tested them and they worked

now its time for unit testing - im gonna use pytest

at first im gonna run the container, ran into a problem that i cant give in the docker run command the --env-file so i had to put the env in travis env vars but dont worry i made sure they are locked so no one can see(the ones that are secret like access key and secret key)

after i put the env vars i finished the docker run command

after that i created my first pytest file -for secert route
i created very minimal pytest files - sorr y i didnt have a lot of time!! 

now for the last stage which is deploy i had to make sure my docker hub token wont be in my .env (For when i send you) and in 
general i dont wanna expose it i put it in the travis ci env


im getting an error while running the docker run command - i realise when i build the image in stage build the stage test does not have that image
in gitlab ci this wont happen!!

anyways i have to push the temp image and then if the image passes the unit testing i will push it to latest 

i decded to do all the testing before i build since building only stage is useless
so yea i have 3 builds now - lintin testing and build and push
also i made my test only one file so the connection will happen once


another problem i accured the docker in travis , when i tried to docker build and add --push it didnt have it?!?! (in gitlab ci this wont happen)

another problem i get is that the pytest is giving me timeout while connecting to the container -
problem was that the app container didnt load fully so couldnt connect to the server

and lastely i created the docker compose and wrote the md files

at the end i got the problem that i cant get the secret - meaning when i do the request to the dynamodb i cant find codeName that is equal to thedoctor.
